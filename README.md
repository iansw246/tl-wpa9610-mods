# TL-WPA9610-Mods
Scripts to modify the TP-Link [TL-WPA9610](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/powerline/tl-wpa9610-kit/)  powerline and wireless access point.

So far, there is one program to disable the DHCP server on the TL-WPA9610.
Its DHCP server causes issues on networks where there is already an existing DHCP server. See the disable-dhcp/ folder for more info.
